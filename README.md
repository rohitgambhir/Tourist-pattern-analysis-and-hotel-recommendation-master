The Expedia dataset contains their customer’s travel information like what they searched for,whether or not the search result was a travel package, the check in and check out date. After analyzing this data, a set of problem statements are identified which will give an overview of the customer’s behavior and requirements.

Given the complexity of the dataset, the following business cases were implemented :

1. To contextualize customer data and predict the likelihood a user will stay at 100 different hotel groups.

2. Predict the purchase of flight packages along with a hotel booking based on user search data.

3. Identifying & Predicting Growth Across the Marketing Channels for Expedia for their Hotel Booking Service.

4. To predict the seasonal booking traffic for each country.
